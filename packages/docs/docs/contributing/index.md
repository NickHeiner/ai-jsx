# Contributing

Contributions are welcome! This is a multidisciplinary project, so skillsets ranging from AI researcher to UI engineer are valuable.

Contribution ideas:
* Build something and let us know what's easy/challenging/surprising.
* Experiment with ways to embed AI directly in UIs and discover which best practices / patterns emerge.
* Look at the `batteries` (e.g. `NaturalLanguageRouter`, `UseTools`) and rework them / build alternate versions. 
* Build out other currently-unimplemented ideas from the [aspirational README](https://github.com/fixie-ai/ai-jsx/blob/main/docs/internal/aspirational-readme.md).
